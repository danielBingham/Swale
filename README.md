Swale
=====

Swale is a stab I took at a highly flexible PHP framework.  The idea to was to build the framework first and foremost around a set of interfaces and then to provide default implementations of those interfaces.  The theory being that by building the framework intentionally around interfaces with out knowledge of their implementation I'd end up with a much more testable, decoupled and extensible framework.  It remains to be seen whether that theory would pan out.

Swale was primarily written as spec work to mine for ideas. So I don't know if I will ever finish it.  It served the purpose I needed it to at the time.  I mined the ideas from it I needed and applied them elsewhere.  I still like the concept, so if I have time I may return to it.
