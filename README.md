Swale
=====

Swale is a stab I took at a highly flexible PHP framework.  The idea to was to build the framework first and foremost around a set of interfaces and then to provide default implementations of those interfaces.  The theory being that by building the framework intentionally around interfaces with out knowledge of their implementation I'd end up with a much more testable, decoupled and extensible framework.  It remains to be seen whether that theory would pan out.

I worked on it primarily as spec work for ideas that were later applied to my day job.  I may eventually get around to finishing the thought.  Or it might never grow past this state.
